    <h2>construction management experience</h2>
    <p>TPEC has the capability to provide construction management, construction inspection and final certification for all types of environmental projects. Our experience is invaluable to waste management operations and real estate development projects. By providing field construction services, TPEC completes the cycle from concept and design through construction and operations.</p>
    <br />
    <p>TPEC field services can carry real estate and environmental management projects from start up operations to provide a smooth transition to the client. These services are provided as support to our design function or as a third party verification for designs and plans produced by others. Our field services offer comprehensive support to our engineering design group. Various aspects of project development are provided below.</p>
