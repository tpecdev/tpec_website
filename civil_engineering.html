    <h2>civil engineering experience</h2>
    <p>TPEC is capable of providing civil site engineering services covering all phases of your development project from conceptual planning, permitting, and preliminary through final design to preparation of plans and specifications for construction bid packages. We can also assist you with your sustainable and low-impact development (LID) projects for improved stormwater management, reducing site runoff, and lowering site energy costs.</p>
    <br />

    <div class="project_desc">
        <h1>PWD Drinking Water System Security Improvements</h1>
        <p>TPEC provided design and construction services for stormwater management systems, perimeter fencing, roadway and parking lots at 3 major water treatment plants, 6 pump stations, and 3 reservoirs in the City of Philadelphia. The scope of work included design plans, specifications, and construction cost estimates for parking lots, roadways, stormwater collection system, perimeter fencing, and communication and security system upgrades.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="project_desc">
        <h1>American Supply Company</h1>
        <p>TPEC has designed land development plans for a new 23,000 sf warehouse to expand the services being provided by American Supply Company. This proposed warehouse will more than double their existing storage capacity. The design phase included multiple stormwater management features (underground infiltration basin, porous pavement, cistern), as well as a new parking lot and loading dock.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="project_desc">
        <h1>Able Plumbing</h1>
        <p>TPEC has prepared land development plans for a 18,775 sf warehousing facility on vacant lands in Philly's East Germantown neighborhood. While re-purposing what was a coal yard long ago, into a state-of-the art plumbing supply house, this facility will also attribute to re-vitalization efforts the area. Stormwater has been flowing unchecked to the Tookany/Tacony-Frankford watershed. Infiltration of more than 3/4 acre of that stormwater is proposed.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="project_desc">
        <h1>Mara II Office Building</h1>
        <p>TPEC prepared design plans for the land development of an 11,000 sq. ft. medical office building in Bucks County, situate on the corner of two state highways in Warminster Township. TPEC plans are consistent with the goals of the owner/developer, the township & meet or exceed the conservancy goals to protect & improve the surface & ground water, reduce flooding, protect base flow & maintain hydrologic balance in the Little Neshaminy Creek sub-watershed.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="project_desc">
        <h1>Philadelphia Southeastern Waterway Restoration</h1>
        <p>TPEC provided an interdisciplinary water resources team to Camp Dresser & McKee and the Philadelphia Water Department to conduct water quality and ecological assessments, review stormwater management practices and restore degraded stream channels and wetlands.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="project_desc">
        <h1>Philadelphia Northeast Water Pollution Control Plant</h1>
        <p>TPEC prepared design plans and specifications for a stormwater management system, yard piping, parking lots, roads, landscaping at new Sludge Thickener Facility, and New Cogeneration Facility working as a subcontractor to AECOM/Metcalf & Eddy and Whitman Requardt & Associates.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="project_desc">
        <h1>Philadelphia Water Department Sampling Station Design</h1>
        <p>Completed the civil/site engineering design portion for two water sampling stations on behalf of Keystone Engineering Group and the Philadelphia Water Department.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="project_desc">
        <h1>Stormwater Management, Philadelphia, PA</h1>
        <p>TPEC provided site engineering and stormwater management system design at a 13.2-acre solid waste management and recycling facility in North Philadelphia.  Our designed site improvements will substantially reduce stormwater runoff and, in turn, significantly reduce the property stormwater fees paid to the Philadelphia Water Department.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="project_desc">
        <h1>Green Roof Projects</h1>
        <p>TPEC performed the structural evaluation of the roof system at The Enterprise Center at 45th Street and Market Street in Philadelphia, PA. Other features planned for the property include a geothermal heating and cooling system, which has been installed, and pervious pavement in the site's parking lot. TPEC also performed structural evaluation including roof support calculations and design modification assistance for a bus shelter located in the City of Philadelphia. The project was part of the Bus Shelter Green Roof Pilot Project initiated by the Mayor's Office and the Philadelphia Water Department Office of Watersheds.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="project_desc">
        <h1>Spring Garden School Building Land Development Services</h1>
        <p>TPEC is currently preparing plans for the land development of a six-story school building with associated parking and stormwater management in the Delaware Direct watershed. This Callowhill project proposes to collect stormwater flows from an adjoining remainder lot. We are able to take advantage of GARP funding in order to help fund this project. The project site borders the busy Main Line subway between Temple University & Chinatown stations.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="project_desc">
        <h1>Ford Road Pumping Station Rehabilitation</h1>
        <p>TPEC has completed the Civil Engineering design support to ATC Group Services-BCM Engineers for the PWD's Ford Road sanitary pumping station. These services consisted of site boundary and topographic surveys, a wetlands survey & delineation, site grading, underground utilities, and a new Driving Surface Aggregate (DSA) type paved driveway to improve the station's operational access. TPEC will be providing further permitting services to secure the Zoning permit, Flood Protection approval and Art Commission approval to advance the project into the construction phase.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="project_desc">
        <h1>PWD Belmont and Southeast Water Tanks Improvement Project</h1>
        <p>TPEC is providing inspection, testing and design support to ATC Group Services-BCM Engineers for the PWD's Elevated Water Storage Tanks to provide improvements, repairs and coating to extend the service life of the tanks. The inspection phase of the project is underway for the tanks. The results and recommendations will form the basis of design for the improvements. Upon completion of design, the proposed design improvements are scheduled to be completed in 2020.</p>
