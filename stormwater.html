    <h2>stormwater experience</h2>
    <p>Beginning on July 1, 2010, the Philadelphia Water Department (PWD) began implementing the four-year phase-in of their new system for billing stormwater charges to commercial property owners in the City. The Philadelphia Water Department has developed a Stormwater Credit Program to qualify existing and/or newly proposed Stormwater Management Practices (SMPs) to help reduce your stormwater fees. <span class="highlight">You may be able to dramatically reduce your monthly stormwater charges at <u>little or no cost</u> to you.</span></p>
    <br />
    <p>The successful implementation of stormwater retrofit projects over the years has opened the doors for many future opportunities here at TPEC. One such area we have expanded to in the past year is stormwater management maintenance for existing structures and systems. PWD requires all property owners that receive stormwater credits to maintain their systems and resubmit their credit applications to continue receiving their credits. TPEC can aid with routine site maintenance. We can inspect stormwater management systems and get uncompliant systems back in compliance, ensuring uninterrupted savings for the owner.</p>
    <br />

    <div class="stormwaternote">
        <h1>What are Stormwater Management Practices (SMPs)?</h1>
        <p><b>Stormwater Management Practices (SMPs)</b> include a range of engineered soil-water-plant systems and subsurface systems designed to capture stormwater, allowing infiltration into the ground, uptake by plants, and/or slow-release into the City sewer system helping to prevent overflow of the City sewer system during rain events.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="stormwaternote">
        <h1>How can I fund my stormwater retrofit project?</h1>
        <p>PWD's <b>Stormwater Grant Program</b> provides funding for property owners to construct stormwater retrofit projects.</p>
        <p>Owners of commercial, industrial, and mixed-use properties as well as most apartment buildings and condos are eligible for stormwater grants to <u>reduce or eliminate</u> the cost of installing SMPs on your property.</p>
        <p>Grants are available for small projects as well as large-scale projects across multiple properties.</p>

        <p>TPEC also provides assistance to the PWD's Public Affairs Division. In 2019, TPEC staff on the Public Engagement Team led over 100 community meetings, engaged thousands of Philadelphia residents, and led the public notification process in order to build support for green infrastructure projects in Philadelphia. Additionally, TPEC staff led programs to promote tap water in the City, as well as supported PWD's efforts to engage in customer research, community grants, events, public art, and data analysis.</p>

        <h1>La Salle University</h1>
        <p>We are pleased to announce that Phase I construction of the La Salle University Stormwater Management Incentive Program (SMIP) was recently completed at the southeast area of the campus. This involved the creation of two rain gardens to manage 6.7 acres of impervious surfaces. TPEC was the lead designer and assisted with construction oversight.</p>

        </div>

        <p>We have also completed the Phase II design. This phase consists of managing 7.1 acres of impervious surfaces from the western part of the campus primarily through the use of underground filtration/detention systems. The purpose of this project is to significantly minimize the amount and/or flow of stormwater runoff entering the City of Philadelphia's sewer system by managing it on-site.</p>

        <p>In collaboration with PEER Environmental, TPEC was able save La Salle University over $60,000 annually from stormwater fees by disconnecting nearly 2,000,000 square feet of impervious area from the public stormwater system.</p>

        <p>The Site is comprised of over 100 acres of gross surface area, of which 47.3 acres are impervious. The goal of the project is to disconnect 90% of the impervious area and manage the first inch of runoff on the area.</p>

        <p>TPEC is proud to have alleviated approximately 1.15 million gallons of runoff from entering the combined sewer system during each rain event that exceeds 1 inch of rainfall.</p>
